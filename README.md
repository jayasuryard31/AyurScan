## Overview

The main objective of this project is to create a mobile application that leverages the capabilities of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict plant details from images. This user-friendly tool caters to plant enthusiasts and nature lovers, offering two primary functionalities: real-time image recognition via the camera feature and image analysis from the device's gallery.

## üå± Features

[Insert Screenshots or GIFs Here]

### Camera Feature üì∏
- Users can capture images of plants in real-time using their device's camera.
- The integrated TensorFlow model, trained on a dataset of plant images, analyzes the captured image.
- The deep learning model identifies the plant species and displays its name, description, and other relevant information to the user.

### Library Option üìö
- Users can choose images from their device's gallery for plant recognition.
- The selected images undergo the same prediction process as real-time captures, providing plant details for personal image collections.

### Comprehensive Plant Database üìä
- The application features a database to store and retrieve plant details, including predictions made by the model.
- Users can easily access this information through the user interface.
